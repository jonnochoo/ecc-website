        h2 Welcome from the Pastor
        p Welcome to the website of Evangelical Chinese Church! This site provides some information about our church which may assist if you are new to Christianity or are looking for a church. However, we would love you to visit us in person as we gather as a church on Sundays, as this is the best way for you to get to know us!
        p We are a diverse community made up of young families, students, young workers and seniors. 
        p We seek to be a church community that demonstrates Jesusâ€™ love and shares the good news of Jesus, so that those who do not know Him might have a personal relationship with God and be part of His church family.
        p Whether you want to find out more about Jesus or are already a Christian, we would love for you to join us at our Sunday service.
        p In Christ, <br /> Pastor Alan Chong
