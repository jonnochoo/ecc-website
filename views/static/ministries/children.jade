          p Way2Go is our childrenâ€™s ministry program, which aims to introduce Jesus to children and teach the Bible. It is for children from pre-school up to year 6. We seek to integrate the teaching syllabus with fun activities including games, drama, singing, craft, short talks and puppets. Our purpose is to show the children that Jesus loves them and that He is the Way to God.
