        h2 Welcome from the Pastor
        p Welcome to the website of Evangelical Chinese Church!
        p This site provides some information about our church which may assist you, if you are new to Christianity or are looking for a church. However, we would love you to visit us in person as this is the best way for us to get to know each other.
        p We are an international community of all age groups. There are many young families, students, young and older working adults and seniors.
        p We seek to be a church community that demonstrates Jesusâ€™ love and shares the Good News of Jesus, so that those who do not know Him might have a personal relationship with Him and be part of His church family.
        p We warmly invite you to join us at our Sunday service.
        p In Christ, <br /> Pastor Alan Chong
